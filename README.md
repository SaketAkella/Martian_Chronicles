# Martian_Chronicles

## Introduction:

Hello people..I'm Akella Saket ECE-B and I've been a part of the standby tasks at amfoss and this is my version of the "Martian_chronicles" project that retrieves images from NASA api and displays in the gui. This readme contains the features and description of the project.


## Features:
### 1.Parameter selection---> 
This allows the user to choose specific number of parameters(in my case three) which would affect the images that are being retrieved. In the project there are three parameters specified- the rover name, the camera name and the launch date(yyyy-mm-dd).

### 2.Fethcing the image--->
This allows the user to download and view the images simultaneously. The fetch button placed in the app directs the user to a place where he can toggle between the retrived images.

### 3.Sending emails--->
There's another pushbutton placed in the same window as the image viewing page. This is the send mail button that will direct the user to email sending page. This allows the user to give the subject, body and recipients list. There's a home button that will direct the user to the first page of the app if he wishes so.


## Conclusion:
I've genuinely enjoyed the process of learning and the making of the app. It was informativie and satisfying. Looking forward to meet you guys at the club.

Regards,
Saket
